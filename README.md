# Decayder
Decayder is the FurezLegacy project on Electron technology

##Furez ?
FurezApi Framework will allow you to exploit file upload vulnerability on website server. The main goal is pretty simple : Test every possibilities of infected files to upload, if the upload is successful:

- giving you a user interface to manage datas
- allowing you to do what you want on server.

Show the folder structure of the website ? Show a specific file ? Zip content ? Download content ? Upload or even delete ? If the API succeed to be upload on the server. You're the new king of this one!

##Why Decayder ?
Where FurezApi and later FurezExploit were boring and long to setup and install, Decayder learn about theses mistakes and fix it for your pleasure. Decayder now propose a better interface to handle the server return and manage it. Same functionnalities but more easy to install, faster to use, better to customize and soon hot new functionnalities for encoding all the request and cookies requests.
